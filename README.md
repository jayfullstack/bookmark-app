Welcome to My Bookmarks WebApp!

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Application using your browser's local storage.

This app functions almost exactly like your browser's bookmarks tab, except I built a neat little UI to present them in a more optimal visual way!

You can "add a bookmark" by clicking the button at the top and enterting in the website you desire to save.

You are more than welcome to close the WebApp tab and reload and you'll still see all your bookmarks!
